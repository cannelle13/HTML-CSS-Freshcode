## Description of My Project

In this repository, I present my solutions for website layout and styling, which I created during my studies in this course. My work includes HTML markup and CSS styles, developed by the tasks provided during each lesson.

My goal was to create a website layout that adheres to modern standards and has a clear structure and style. My project is the result of my efforts and dedication to learning and improving my skills in web development.

The design of the website layout was provided by the educational center Freshcode. You can view the design at the following link: [Website Layout on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GlDZFF1nSYyOXBhOH3ACFo/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82?type=design&node-id=0-44&mode=design&t=YUjTpiPlF17Q6WGY-0).

My website has been published on [GitHub Pages](https://cannelle13.github.io/HTML-CSS-Freshcode) for your convenience.

I would appreciate your comments and feedback on my work. Thank you to Freshcode for providing the opportunity to learn in this course and enhance my web development skills.
